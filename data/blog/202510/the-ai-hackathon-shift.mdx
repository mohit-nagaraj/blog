Remember the good ol' hackathon days from a couple of years ago? You'd walk into a room, and the vibe was just electric. Full of nervous energy, stale pizza, and the fear of the clock ticking down. The goal was to build *something*, *anything*, before the deadline. It was a total mess of caffeine, friends, and desperately trying to understand confusing documents.

Just a year ago, I was in a hackathon, trying to build a real-time chat. We were using WebSockets for the first time, and man, it was a nightmare. We spent almost the whole first day just to get a stable connection. Our code was full of `console.log`s, our brains were fried, and we were losing hope. But then, around 3 AM, it finally worked. The connection was stable, a message went through, and that feeling of victory was amazing. We didn't just build a feature; we had won a battle. That win felt *real*.

Fast forward to a month ago. Another hackathon, another big idea. This time, we wanted to build a full-stack app with a machine learning recommendation engine. A year ago, that would have been impossible. This time? It was just a few prompts. "Set up a Next.js frontend with TailwindCSS," "Write a Python backend with Flask," "Create a simple recommendation model."

We built the whole thing in a day. We even had time to make it look good. We won. But it felt... different. The high-fives weren't as loud, the feeling of achievement was... less. It felt like we took a cable car to the top of the mountain instead of climbing it ourselves.

## The "Before Times": A Trip Down Memory Lane

That story is not just mine. Hackathons used to be a big deal. It was you and your team against a mountain of docs that made no sense. The fun was in the struggle. You'd spend hours, literally HOURS, trying to figure out some API's login flow. Your browser was a warzone of Stack Overflow tabs, half-read tutorials, and the classic "how to center a div" search at 3 AM.

There was a certain magic to it. That moment when you finally, after trying a million things, got it to work? Pure happiness. You didn't just build an app; you earned it. With your blood, sweat, and tears (mostly tears).

## Enter the AI Dost

Then, things started to change. Tools like GPT, Claude, and Gemini joined the party. Suddenly, the problems that made hackathons a challenge just... disappeared.

Instead of fighting with docs, you could just ask.

**Before:** "Okay team, let's waste the next four hours reading this 200-page PDF for this payment API. Try not to cry."

**Now:** "Hey Claude, write me a NodeJS server that uses X API to do Y with Z library. Make it snappy."

Thirty seconds later, you have working code. The "how to start" problem is gone. The "how to implement" is just a prompt away. It's super efficient. Anyone can do it. But... is it still a hackathon?

## The Rise of "Vibe Coding"

This new style is what I call "Vibe Coding." You don't need to know the small details anymore. You just need a vibe, a general idea. The AI does the rest.

It's like being a movie director who doesn't know how a camera works. You just shout "I want a dramatic shot of a cat!" and a robot does it. It's cool, you get the shot, but did you *learn* how to film? Probably not.

The whole culture has changed from deep technical work to just making things quickly. It's all about the "what," not the "how."

## So, Is It Good or Bad? Kya Scene Hai?

Honestly, I'm confused. On one hand, AI has made it easy for everyone. Anyone can build their idea in a weekend, no matter their experience. That's great! The speed is mind-blowing. You can build and change things faster than ever.

But on the other hand, something is missing. The "scary/fun" part is gone. The pressure that forced you to learn is gone, replaced by an easy prompt. We're getting great results, but are we becoming better developers? Are we creating coders who can't work without an AI friend?

The solutions also feel a bit... the same. When everyone uses the same AI, you see the same kind of answers. The unique, messy, and creative solutions that came from pure desperation are becoming rare.

## The Verdict: Different, Not Better

So, what now? I don't think AI is the bad guy. It's a super powerful tool. But the spirit of hackathons has definitely changed. It's less about the struggle and more about the easy ride.

Maybe this is just how hackathons are evolving. Maybe the new challenge isn't about fighting with code, but about having the most creative ideas and writing the best prompts.

Or maybe I'm just an old guy complaining about new things.

Either way, the next time you're at a hackathon and see someone finish a project with a few prompts, just remember the ones who had to read PDFs. We salute you.
